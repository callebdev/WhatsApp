WhatApp
============================================

### My version of Whatsapp

This is something that I was working on back in 2018 when I started learning Android Development, created an app similar to whatsapp where users can
trade messages privately, and in groups. It has no status messages just like the official whatsapp, and it doesn't use Phone Number Authentication.
I figured it would've been a lot easier to implement E-mail and Password Authentication back then.

#### Authentication Screens:
- This uses Firebase Authentication.
- When you sign up you are automatically redirected to the main app screen.

#### Main Screens:
- Here you two Tabs, one that shows your active chats(Empty at the moment) and a tab where you can create groups and see all the contacts that you can interact with.

#### Creating a Group:
- Here I created a group called testing, and initiated a chat with a user called Doilio, so now our Active chat list is populated.

#### Chat Screens
 Here you can see three screens:
- One where I am chatting with a user called "doilio" and has no profile photo/
- One where two users are chatting in a group called Testing so their names are displayed in the chat bubble
- One where I have sent a message to a user called "Doilio", he has a profile picture, and didn't reply yet.
